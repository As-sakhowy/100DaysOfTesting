# playwright-foundations
Practice repo for mastering Playwright automation with demo apps (DemoQA, Herokuapp)

# Playwright Foundations 🚀

This repository contains my practice tests as I learn **Playwright** automation step by step.  
The focus is on testing real-world demo apps:

- **Week 1:** [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com) – Forms, checkboxes, dropdowns, tables, alerts.
- **Week 2:** [The Internet (Herokuapp)](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com) – Login, alerts, dynamic loading, file upload.

## ✅ Goals
- Master Playwright basics (`page.goto`, `locator`, `getByRole`, `getByText`).
- Write stable, non-flaky tests.
- Learn screenshot & video recording.
- Automate 10+ scenarios confidently.

## 📂 Structure
- `tests/demoqa/` → All DemoQA scenarios.
- `tests/herokuapp/` → All Herokuapp scenarios.
