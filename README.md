# 100DaysOfTesting

This repository documents my 100-day journey into mastering **Software Testing**.  
The focus is on building hands-on skills across different testing types, tools, and domains while creating a strong portfolio of practical work.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Become highly skilled in **UI automation with Playwright (TypeScript/JavaScript)**.  
- Gain expertise in **API automation with Postman/Newman and Rest Assured**.  
- Explore **performance testing** using open-source tools.  
- Practice **security testing** basics on safe, intentionally vulnerable applications.  
- Build a professional testing portfolio that demonstrates real-world scenarios.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **UI Automation**: Playwright (JavaScript/TypeScript)  
- **API Automation**: Postman, Newman, Rest Assured  
- **Performance**: JMeter, k6 (where applicable)  
- **Security**: OWASP tools and test practices

## 📚 Practice Apps
I’ll be testing on a range of open-source and demo apps, from beginner-friendly to advanced:

### Beginner Level (Playwright foundations)
- [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) – forms, checkboxes, tables, alerts  
- [The Internet (Herokuapp)](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) – dozens of small automation challenges  
- [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) – full e-commerce flow  

### Intermediate Level
- [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) – HR workflows  
- [Parabank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm) – banking operations  
- [Bookshelf App](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/getting-started-java/tree/master/bookshelf) – CRUD sample app  

### Advanced Level
- [RealWorld App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) – Medium.com clone with APIs  
- [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) – deliberately insecure e-commerce site  

### Pro Level
