# 100DaysOfTesting

This repository documents my 100-day journey into mastering **Software Testing**.  
The focus is on building hands-on skills across different testing types, tools, and domains while creating a strong portfolio of practical work.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Become highly skilled in **UI automation with Playwright (TypeScript/JavaScript)**.  
- Gain expertise in **API automation with Postman/Newman and Rest Assured**.  
- Explore **performance testing** using open-source tools.  
- Practice **security testing** basics on safe, intentionally vulnerable applications.  
- Build a professional testing portfolio that demonstrates real-world scenarios.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **UI Automation**: Playwright (JavaScript/TypeScript)  
- **API Automation**: Postman, Newman, Rest Assured  
- **Performance**: JMeter, k6 (where applicable)  
- **Security**: OWASP tools and test practices

# playwright-foundations
Practice repo for mastering Playwright automation with demo apps (DemoQA, Herokuapp)

# Playwright Foundations 🚀

This repository contains my practice tests as I learn **Playwright** automation step by step.  
The focus is on testing real-world demo apps:

- **Week 1:** [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com) – Forms, checkboxes, dropdowns, tables, alerts.
- **Week 2:** [The Internet (Herokuapp)](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com) – Login, alerts, dynamic loading, file upload.

## ✅ Goals
- Master Playwright basics (`page.goto`, `locator`, `getByRole`, `getByText`).
- Write stable, non-flaky tests.
- Learn screenshot & video recording.
- Automate 10+ scenarios confidently.

## 📂 Structure
- `tests/demoqa/` → All DemoQA scenarios.
- `tests/herokuapp/` → All Herokuapp scenarios.

## 🛠️ Setup
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/playwright-foundations.git
cd playwright-foundations
npm install
