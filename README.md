# Playwright Automation – DemoQA

This repository contains **end-to-end UI automation** for [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) built with **Playwright**.  
It showcases my ability to design, write, and organize automated test cases for real-world scenarios.

---

## 📌 Highlights
- Automated **forms, tables, alerts, frames, modals, widgets, and interactions**.  
- Covered **file upload/download**, **searchable dropdowns**, **multiple windows/tabs**, and **iframes**.  
- Validated **broken links/images** and tested **Book Store Application** workflows (login, search, add/remove books).  
- Applied **Playwright best practices**: locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`), assertions, waits, and reusable test structure.  
- Tests organized by **feature/page** for maintainability.  

---

## 🛠 Tools
- **Playwright** (Test runner + automation)  
- **Node.js**  
- **VS Code + GitHub**  


🎯 Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Automate complex UI scenarios.

Write clean, reliable tests.

Apply skills in a realistic QA project setting
